              <h3>The Great Economy Unbalance is over. Duping glitch PATCHED.</h3>
                <p>The Great Economy Unbalance was the time period between 8/01/2025 and 10/11/2025, when the duping glitch got patched.</p>
                <p>During the Great Economy Unbalance, rare items started to become common. Galaxy items, such as the Galaxy Hookshot, became common, as members of the Upper Duping class decided to dump their trash in code GIVEAWAY and GIVEAWAY1, said trash being GALAXY ITEMS.</p>
                <p>Now, the glitch was patched and the economy is starting to recover. The Pay-to-Play class must've been FURIOUS at the upper dupers.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Comment from a member of the Upper Duping class: "I kinda miss the duping, now I can't get infinite bolts. And I lose ~4m a day when I play with my friend."</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The max bolts is 9.99 million bolts.</p>
                <p>However, the Lower Modding class and Upper Modding class may step in and restart the Unbalance. If they do, the economy will CRASH harder than ever and the game will die.</p>
                <p><strong>Stop the Upper/Lower modders at all costs.</strong></p>
